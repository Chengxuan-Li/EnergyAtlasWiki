# Template Definition and Assignment

Workflow for creating building archetypes (templates) and assigning them to buildings in your dataset.

## Overview

Template definition and assignment is a critical step that maps your building data to representative energy models (archetypes). This workflow covers creating archetypes, defining assignment rules, and applying them to buildings.

## Step 1: Load Data

## Next Steps

After assigning archetypes:

- [Running and Calibrating](running-calibrating.md) - Run energy simulations
- [Archetype Object](../objects/archetype.md) - Learn about archetype structure
- [Archetype Assignment Rule](../objects/archetype-assignment-rule.md) - Rule specifications
