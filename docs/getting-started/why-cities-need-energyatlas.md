# Why Cities Need EnergyAtlas

Urban areas account for over 70% of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. EnergyAtlas provides cities with the tools needed to understand, plan, and manage urban energy systems effectively.

## The Urban Energy Challenge

### Growing Urban Population

By 2050, nearly 70% of the world's population will live in cities. This rapid urbanization increases demand for:

- Building energy services (heating, cooling, lighting)
- Transportation infrastructure
- Water and waste management systems

### Climate Goals

Cities worldwide have committed to ambitious climate targets:

- Carbon neutrality by 2050 or earlier
- Significant reductions in building energy consumption
- Integration of renewable energy systems

### Limited Resources

City planners and energy managers face constraints:

- Limited time and budget for detailed building audits
- Fragmented data across multiple departments
- Need for rapid, actionable insights

## How EnergyAtlas Helps

### Comprehensive Urban Analysis

EnergyAtlas enables city-wide energy assessments without requiring individual building audits:

- **Scale**: Model entire building stocks efficiently
- **Speed**: Generate results in days, not months
- **Cost**: Fraction of traditional audit-based approaches

### Evidence-Based Planning

Support policy and program decisions with data:

- **Baseline Assessment**: Understand current energy consumption patterns
- **Scenario Analysis**: Evaluate policy and program impacts before implementation
- **Target Setting**: Establish realistic, data-driven energy reduction goals

### Retrofit Prioritization

Identify high-impact opportunities:

- **Building-Level**: Target buildings with highest energy savings potential
- **District-Level**: Plan district-scale retrofit programs
- **Portfolio-Level**: Optimize utility and program administrator investments

### Integration with City Systems

EnergyAtlas integrates with existing city data and workflows:

- **GIS Integration**: Works with standard geospatial formats
- **Data Sources**: Leverages tax assessor, utility, and survey data
- **Visualization**: Export results for use in planning tools and public engagement

## Use Cases
