# Welcome to EnergyAtlas

Welcome to EnergyAtlas! This guide will help you get started with the platform.

## Overview

EnergyAtlas is designed to help urban planners, researchers, and energy analysts model building energy consumption at the urban scale. The platform combines data integration, building archetype assignment, energy simulation, and scenario analysis into a unified workflow.

## Key Features

- **Urban Data Integration**: Import and manage diverse urban datasets
- **Automated Archetype Assignment**: Assign building archetypes based on available data
- **Energy Simulation**: Run building energy simulations using industry-standard engines
- **Scenario Analysis**: Compare retrofit scenarios and policy interventions
- **Visualization**: Interactive maps and charts for exploring results

## Getting Started

1. **Import Your Data**: Start by importing your urban building data
2. **Assign Archetypes**: Use the automated archetype assignment tool
3. **Run Simulations**: Configure and run energy simulations
4. **Analyze Results**: Explore results through interactive visualizations
