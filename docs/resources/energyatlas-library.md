# EnergyAtlas Library

The EnergyAtlas Library provides pre-built resources to accelerate your UBEM projects, including building archetypes, weather data, and retrofit measures.

## Library Contents

### **[Archetype Library](archetype-library.md)**

Pre-defined building archetypes representing common building types, vintages, and characteristics. Use these archetypes directly or as templates for creating custom archetypes.

**Related**: [Archetype Objects Guide](../references/objects/archetype.md)

### **[Weather Library](weather-library.md)**

Weather files (TMY, EPW) for locations worldwide. Essential for accurate energy simulations.

**Related**: [Weather File Objects Guide](../references/objects/weather-file.md)

### **[Retrofit Measures Library](retrofit-measures-library.md)**

Pre-configured retrofit measures representing common energy efficiency improvements. Use these to model retrofit scenarios.

**Related**: [Retrofit Measure Objects Guide](../references/objects/retrofit-measure.md)

## Using Library Resources

1. **Browse** available resources in each library
2. **Select** resources matching your project needs
3. **Import** into your EnergyAtlas project
4. **Customize** as needed for your specific application
