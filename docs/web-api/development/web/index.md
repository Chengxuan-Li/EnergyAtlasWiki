# EnergyAtlasWeb Development Guide

EnergyAtlasWeb is the web and cross-platform frontend for EnergyAtlas. It consists of an
ASP.NET backend serving a JavaScript-driven UI, and can run either as a standalone web app
in a browser or as a native desktop application via .NET MAUI.

This section documents the job system, real-time logging, file handling, and execution mode
differences that developers need to understand when extending the application.


## Job system

EnergyAtlasWeb supports two kinds of jobs:

- **[GUI Job](gui-job.md)** — Automatically generates a complete job page (input form,
  real-time logs, output display) from C# attribute-decorated input/output classes. Use this
  when the job requires user-provided parameters or produces downloadable artefacts.

- **[GUI-less Job](guiless-job.md)** — A single-click background task with no input form.
  Parameters are hard-coded or read from server configuration. Use this for batch processing,
  infrastructure tasks, or anything that doesn't need user input.

Both job types share the same real-time logging infrastructure built on SignalR.


## Supporting infrastructure

- **[SignalR Logging](report-logs.md)** — How jobs report progress to the frontend in real
  time. Covers `IJobReporter`, `JobSignal`, `BinaryProgress` (spinner), `TQDM` (progress bar),
  and the SignalR delivery pipeline.

- **[Working with Local Files](file-sys-access.md)** — How file picking, upload, and output
  artefacts work. Covers the MAUI file picker bridge, the artifact sink for in-memory downloads,
  and on-disk reveal-in-folder outputs.

- **[Execution Modes](exec-modes.md)** — The two modes (browser and local/MAUI) that control
  how the frontend interacts with files and the host environment. Covers configuration,
  detection, and what changes between modes.
