# UBEM Wiki

A comprehensive guide to Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) concepts, methodologies, and best practices.

## What is UBEM?

Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) is a computational approach to estimate and analyze energy consumption at the urban scale. Unlike traditional building-level energy modeling, UBEM considers the entire building stock of a city or district, enabling:

- City-wide energy assessments
- Policy impact analysis
- Retrofit scenario planning
- Energy system integration
- Climate action planning

## Key Concepts

### Building Archetypes

Building archetypes represent typical building characteristics (construction, systems, occupancy) used to model groups of similar buildings efficiently.

**Learn more**: [Archetype Library](../resources/archetype-library.md)

### Urban Data Integration

Integrating diverse data sources including building footprints, tax assessor records, satellite imagery, and survey data to create comprehensive building inventories.

**Learn more**: [Urban Data Integration Workflow](../references/workflows/urban-data-integration.md)

### Calibration

The process of adjusting model parameters to match observed energy consumption data, improving model accuracy.

## UBEM Fundamentals

For an introduction to UBEM concepts and methodologies, see:

- **[UBEM Fundamentals](../getting-started/ubem-fundamentals.md)** - Core concepts and principles
- **[Build Your First UBEM](../getting-started/first-ubem.md)** - Step-by-step tutorial

## EnergyAtlas Approach

EnergyAtlas implements UBEM through a five-stage workflow:

1. **Urban Data Integration** - Import and process building data
2. **Template Definition and Assignment** - Create and assign building archetypes
3. **Running and Calibrating** - Execute simulations and calibrate models
4. **Scenario Design and Simulation** - Model retrofit and policy scenarios
5. **Results View** - Analyze and visualize outcomes
